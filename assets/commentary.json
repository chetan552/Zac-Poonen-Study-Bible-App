The Word is a title for Jesus Christ, representing the visible expression of the invisible God, similar to how spoken words express a person's thoughts. The 'Word' existed from the beginning, meaning from all eternity, a time that predates the creation described in Genesis 1:1. The verse also states 'the Word was with God,' which indicates there was another person who was also God, identified as the Father, with whom Christ was. The third statement, 'the Word was God,' makes it clear that Jesus Christ is God Himself. From this verse, it's concluded that God is more than one person, existing in three persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—all of whom are equally and eternally God, yet there is only one God, not three gods."

This life was also the 'light of men,' a light that comes from God and is meant for humanity to walk in. The light that Christ brought to earth was not a primary doctrine or a teaching, but a life. When Christianity becomes focused on doctrines or patterns instead of this life, it has 'missed the main thing'. While doctrines and patterns are not unimportant, they are secondary to the life of Christ, which is what makes a person a Christian. Unity comes from the life of Jesus, not from a specific doctrine or church pattern."

Sin is stronger than human will, and Satan is stronger than human power. The secret to a victorious life is not in doctrine, determination, or self-discipline, but in receiving the life of God. It is impossible to overcome sin and darkness without receiving the life of God through the Holy Spirit. The light will overpower the darkness when a person yields to the Holy Spirit and allows Him to take possession of their entire being."

It is a personal act of receiving Christ, not just repeating a formula with one's lips. 'To believe in His name' is synonymous with receiving Him; it is not merely intellectual belief, as even demons believe and shudder.

This birth must come from God. It is a supernatural work of the Holy Spirit, similar to how the body of Jesus was supernaturally created in Mary's womb.

In His flesh, He manifested the glory of God, which is a perfect balance of grace and truth. Jesus emptied Himself of the 'fullness of God,' meaning the privileges and powers He had as God, while retaining His deity. The mystery of godliness is that God was revealed in the flesh.

John the Baptist said that he had a very definite word from God that when you see the Spirit descending upon one and remaining upon him, that is the one who will baptize other people in the Holy Spirit. John the Baptist says, 'I am only baptizing in water, but this one who is greater than me is going to baptize in the Holy Spirit'. The word baptism is a Greek word which means immersion. Jesus is called here the immerser in the Holy Spirit, like John was an immerser. John the Baptist means John the immerser, the one who was plunging people into the water. In the same way, Jesus is also a plunger or an immerser in the Holy Spirit. He drenches us with the Holy Spirit's power. This was never possible under the Old Testament, but here in the New Testament, Jesus baptizes or immerses in the Holy Spirit. This promise is repeated in the first five books of the Bible in Matthew chapter 3, Mark chapter 1, Luke chapter 3, John chapter 1, and Acts chapter 1. We read of the baptism in the Holy Spirit or of being baptized in the Holy Spirit or of being immersed in the Holy Spirit. The very first two promises in the New Testament are: the first in Matthew 1:21, 'You shall call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins,' and the second in Matthew chapter 3 is, 'He shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit' (Matthew 3:11). These are the two experiences that we need to know as children of God: first, being saved from our sins; second, being baptized or immersed in the Holy Spirit and fire. The Holy Spirit is symbolized as fire that burns up the chaff and comes and endues us with power. It's like the petrol being ignited in a scooter or a car with fire so that it propels the vehicle forward. Without the fire, any amount of petrol in the vehicle is no use; it needs the spark, the fire, to propel it. What many believers need today is the fire of the Holy Spirit. Their tanks are full of petrol, full of the word of God, but the power, the fire, is missing, and so they are pushing their vehicles instead of driving them. What you need is to be baptized in the Holy Spirit, to be immersed in the Holy Spirit and fire. There is only one whom God has appointed to baptize in the Holy Spirit, and that is Jesus himself. A man can baptize you in water, but only Jesus can baptize you in the Holy Spirit. Here is a promise: Jesus is the one who baptizes or immerses in the Holy Spirit. This is not a point to be discussed and argued theologically; it is something to be experienced in our life. It is impossible to live the Christian life without this power."

Unfortunately, the message that many Christian churches are preaching today is only 'come and hear,' 'come and hear' this new doctrine that we have, 'come and hear' this new preacher who has come from some other country. No, that's not primarily what we are to say, but 'come and see' what this message has produced. If it has not produced anything, then what is the use of telling them to come and hear? What has it produced in your relationship with your wife or your husband, or in you as a father towards your children? Has it made you more patient? Has it made you overcome anger in your home? Have you stopped shouting at your wife? Can you say to others, 'Come and see what the gospel has produced in my home'?

What a wonderful commendation if Jesus can say that about you and me: 'an Israelite in whom there is no guile,' no hypocrisy. Not perfect, not sinless, but no pretense. That is what we need to hear. First of all, Nathanael was not even converted; he was not born again. He hadn't come to a life of victory over sin, but he was free from pretense and hypocrisy and guile, and that is the first step. Jesus chooses such people, Jesus calls such people even today. What is he looking for? Freedom from hypocrisy and pretense and guile. Does he find that in you, dear friend? Does he find freedom from hypocrisy and guile and pretense in you as he did in Nathanael? Then there is great hope."

    "text": "What will you see? He said to him, 'Truly I say to you, you shall see the heavens opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.' This is a reference to the time when Jacob lay down in Bethel and had a dream and he saw a ladder going up to heaven and the angels of God ascending and descending on that ladder. Here Jesus says that that ladder is the Son of Man. That ladder was a picture of Christ all the way from heaven down to the earth with its last rung right down, with its feet of the ladder right placed on earth. The Word became flesh; he became exactly like us, he was made like his brethren (Hebrews 2:17) in all things. He is the only ladder to heaven; he is the only way that we can go up into God's kingdom. It's very significant that he refers to that incident in Jacob's life here, because Jacob was the one whose name was changed to Israel, and in Jacob at that time there was a lot of guile and deception. He had deceived his father before running away saying that he was Esau. But now in Nathanael, we read a person in whom we can read John 1:47 like this, 'Behold an Israelite indeed in whom there is no Jacob,' in whom there is no guile. And that is our calling today: there should be no Jacob in us, no deceiving of others, no pretense, no pretending to be Esau, but a true Israelite freed from hypocrisy. Such a person sees Jesus as the ladder from earth to heaven and the angels of God ascending and descending upon him."

    "text": "Jesus said to her, 'Woman, what do I have to do with you? My hour has not yet come.' Jesus made it very clear to Mary right at the outset of his ministry that he had no relationship with her now like he had for 30 years in Nazareth as her obedient son. We read in Luke 2:52 that Jesus went down to Nazareth and he was subject to Joseph and Mary all through those years. He continued in subjection to them. But now a time had come after his baptism where he entered into his ministry as the Messiah and it was very important for Mary to recognize that that old relationship was gone. So he turns around to her and says words which are very strong. He calls her 'woman,' not mother, but 'woman.' He had never spoken to her like this in all his 30 years in Nazareth; there he had called her mother. But now he entered into his ministry as the savior of the world and he did not want any human attachment anymore to his relatives. The blood relationship meant nothing. Later on he once said, 'Who are my mother and my brothers and my sisters? These who hear the word of God and do it, these who do the will of God.' So Jesus broke off that human relationship to his relatives and that is what he told his disciples too: 'If you want to be my disciples you got to hate your father, mother, brother, sister, wife and children,' which means 'break off that human relationship.' Jesus sets an example. 'What do I have to do with you?' that old relationship is no longer valid. 'My hour has not yet come.' Now I respond to the leading of the Holy Spirit. It's very important for us to recognize that in Christ the earthly relationships are broken. We come into a new creation and new relationships with brothers and sisters in the church. The expression 'my hour has not yet come' means that he would do things only when prompted and led by the Holy Spirit. He was not going to respond to human ideas and suggestions of what they felt was necessary, but to the leading of the Holy Spirit."

The beginning of his signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee and manifested his glory, and his disciples believed in him. There are a number of things that we can learn from this miracle. One is that where Jesus is not given the first place, the wine will always run out. In every marriage, the wine of joy and abundance will run out if Jesus is not present. But if he is there, he will always make sure there is an abundance. He can take the water, the ordinary things of life, and turn it into wine from heaven, supernaturally bringing something glorious into a very ordinary thing. He does not do it all by himself; he seeks to work together with us. Right through John's gospel we see the principle of the new covenant, which is partnership with Jesus. We don't do it alone; neither does Jesus do it alone. It is in fellowship with us that he works. He could have created water in those water pots without a problem, but he doesn't do it. He asks the servants to fill the water pots with water and then he turns the water into wine. So the servants also had a part in it because they filled the water pots with water and they drew it out and served it. It was a cooperation, a partnership that Jesus was trying to teach his disciples and all of us. The Christian life is a partnership where we take his yoke upon us and work together with him. There were six stone water pots set there for the Jewish custom of purification, containing twenty or thirty gallons each. Jesus said to them, 'Fill the water pots with water.' That's the other thing we learn here: that we have to work hard, no half-heartedness, fill it up to the brim, up to the brim, with complete wholeheartedness, hard work. And then Jesus does a miracle. He doesn't do what we can do; he does what we cannot do."

    "verse": 1,
    "text": "Here is a letter written by Jude, who was one of the physical blood brothers of Jesus, brother of James, who has written the epistle of James, also another brother of Jesus, son of Mary, and along with James, had been unbelieving in\n\nthe entire earthly lifetime of Jesus as far as we know and was converted after the resurrection and who obviously repented so wholeheartedly of his years of unbelief that he turned out to be a bondservant of Jesus Christ and here he writes Jude a slave a bond slave of Jesus Christ we've considered that before that there is a difference between a servant and a slave\n\nJude was a bond slave. A slave is one who has no rights over himself. He only has to do the will of his master. And when they said that they were bond slaves of Jesus Christ, it meant that they had given up their own will in everything. They had given up their own plans, their own ambitions, and they were there to do the will of Jesus Christ their Lord. Brother of James, to those who are the called, beloved in God the Father,\n\nand kept for Jesus Christ beloved of God and kept preserved for Jesus Christ may mercy peace and love be multiplied to you he prays first of all that God will show them mercy something that we all need and that the peace of God is a greeting that one finds at the beginning of almost every episode the peace of God reigning in our hearts and bringing peace between believers\n\nAnd love, the love of God ruling in our hearts and being manifested in the mutual relationships of believers, be multiplied to you as God gives it to us, made increased so that this peace and love can be manifested in our relationship with one another. And then Jude writes, Beloved, while I was making every effort to write to you about our common salvation, he says, I actually wanted to write something about\n\nwhat our salvation is all about. I think something like Paul's letter to the Romans on justification and sanctification, etc. But he says, that's what I was planning to write to you all about, about the way of salvation. But as I thought about that, I felt the necessity, I felt constrained to write to you appealing that you earnestly contend for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints.\n\nAs he planned to write about salvation, the Holy Spirit constrained him to write about something else. Because there was something else that needed to be written as part of Scripture. There was something else that these people needed to hear about. Because the Gospel had been corrupted even by that time when Jude wrote in the first century. And he says, the Spirit of God constrained me to write about something else. And it's very good to listen to the voice of the Spirit\n\nWhen he leads us to write about something else than what we plan to write. And there Jude, being a bond slave of Jesus Christ, gave up his own will and what he wanted to write and wrote what the Spirit prompted him to write. No doubt that was the right thing.\n\nVery often, what our reason tells us is not the right thing. It's the prompting of the spirit that's right. And we need to live by the promptings of the spirit and set aside what our reason tells us. Reason suggested to Jude to write something about salvation, but the spirit prompted him to write about something more important, to contend earnestly, to fight spiritually, not physically. Our kingdom is not of this world. We do not fight physically, but spiritually to carry on a vigorous defense, to stoutly defend.\n\nThe faith, the true doctrine which has been entrusted by God through Jesus Christ, through the apostles to the saints once for all. He says there are people corrupting it. And he says I want you to fight for it, preserve it. For he says certain persons have crept in unobserved. The devil's got his fifth columnists, his agents whom he sends into churches to corrupt the doctrine, to corrupt the life.\n\nHe says these were long beforehand marked out for this condemnation. They were written down as sentenced for judgment. Ungodly persons. Who are these people who have crept into the churches and corrupted the faith? The very first mark of them is that they are ungodly. They may be clever, but as J.B. Phillips paraphrases it, they have no real reverence for God.\n\nWhen a man doesn't have reverence for God, that means when a man doesn't fear God, the Bible calls him ungodly. And such an ungodly person is a perfect person for Satan to use as a fifth columnist in a church. One who can corrupt the church and its doctrine. These people who have crept in, he says, the first mark of them is that they don't have any fear of God. And when a person doesn't have any fear of God,\n\nHe begins to have a very loose and lax attitude towards sin. Do you know that it's possible to intellectually understand all the doctrines correctly and yet to have a very loose attitude towards sin? Because a right attitude towards sin doesn't just come through understanding various doctrines. It comes through the fear of God. It doesn't say an understanding of doctrine is the beginning of wisdom, but the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\n\nAnd these people have turned the grace of our God into licentiousness and deny our only Master and Lord Jesus Christ. Notice what these people who have a lack of the fear of God do. They twist the message of God's grace into something that becomes a license for them to sin.\n\nNow the reason why the book of Jude, Paul Jude's letter has a particular application for today and the days in which we live, is because these persons have crept into Christendom today as well, who proclaim a loose and a lax attitude towards sin. And how do they do it? By speaking of the grace of God as something that is constantly there to cleanse us,\n\nand forgive us and it becomes something that eventually turns out to be a license for sin and thus they deny our only master and Lord Jesus Christ. It's almost as though they say Jesus Christ hasn't come because under the Old Testament law, the Old Testament law itself put a certain fear of God into people. The law of Moses taught people a certain fear of God.\n\nAnd if people say that we are now gone beyond law, we have come to grace, and they've lost that basic fear of God which even the law brought, what does it amount to? It amounts to denying Jesus Christ. It amounts to denying that Jesus Christ has ever come. Or, it must be another Jesus, who is lower than Moses, who is not even able to raise his followers to the level that Moses raised his followers to.\n\nIt's amazing the fear of God that the law brought into the lives of God-fearing Israelites. And when we see Christians who claim to be following Jesus Christ, in whose lives there is sometimes not even a small percentage of that fear of God, which those Old Testament followers of Moses had, then we can say that must be another Jesus they are following. Because the true Jesus Christ must certainly be able to raise people to a higher level\n\nThen Moses raised people in the Old Testament. And so he says these people have turned the grace of God into licentiousness and deny our only master and Lord Jesus Christ. They have perverted the grace of God into immorality. They live in sin and they cover it all up by saying the blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin. For example, there is a very common expression found among believers called the blood covers us.\n\nAnd it's accepted. Lord, cover us with your blood, people pray. But have you noticed that there's not a single place in the New Testament where it speaks about the blood covering us? The covering of the blood of bulls and goats was in the Old Testament. In the New Testament, it speaks not about covering, but it speaks about the blood of Jesus cleansing us, removing that sin altogether, cleansing it away and delivering us from its power.\n\nHere is an example of how God's word is twisted in these days to mean something other than what it means, resulting in Christians living at a far lower level than even the followers of Moses. The grace of God has been turned into license for sin. These are the days in which we live. And let's remember this.\n\nWhen we pervert the grace of God into a license for sin, we are actually denying our true Lord and Master Jesus Christ. And that is why we need in this day to contend earnestly, wholeheartedly, even if it makes us unpopular, for that true faith which has been delivered to the saints once for all, which is meant to deliver us from sin's power completely. Let's turn today to the epistle of Jude and"

    "text": "though you know all these things once for all, that the Lord, after saving a people out of the land of Egypt, subsequently destroyed those who did not believe. There are many people who feel that once the Lord has saved you, he cannot destroy you.\n\nAnd that is the reason why many people take a loose and a lax attitude towards sin. They feel that now I have accepted Christ, I can virtually live as I like. And this type of teaching has led to a very lax attitude towards sin. And therefore, Jude writes, he says, I want to remind you, you people know how that Old Testament redemption from Egypt of the Israelites is a picture of redemption by the blood of the Lamb?\n\nWell, what did God do with those 600,000 men who came out of Egypt? Even though God had saved them, He destroyed them because they did not believe. And He gives another example. He says, think of the angels who did not keep their own domain. Those angels were under the anointing in the beginning. Even Lucifer was called the anointed cherub. He was an anointed angel and yet he lost the anointing. They did not keep their own domain.\n\nbut abandoned their proper abode. God has kept them in eternal bonds under darkness for the judgment of the great day. What do we learn from this? That when God created the angels, he drew a certain boundary around them. They were to stay within that boundary, but they did not stay within that boundary. This is probably referring to the angels whom we read of in Genesis chapter 6, who went down in the days of Noah,\n\nand indulged in sexual sin in some way, we're not able to understand fully. But they did not stay within the sphere that God had apportioned for them, their domain. They did not stay in their proper abode, and therefore God judged them. When God made Adam and Eve, He drew a boundary around them. For example, the tree of knowledge of good and evil was outside that boundary. They were not supposed to go outside that boundary and touch and eat of that tree. But they did, and they sinned.\n\nAnd this has been man's sin through the ages. When God gives us commandments, we can say that those commandments are like a boundary that God has drawn around us. And when we disobey those commandments,\n\nBecause we think we have accepted Christ and the grace of God will take care of it, all that. And I violate God's commandments and His laws and I go outside the boundary that God has placed around me through those commandments. I am committing the same sin that the angels committed, who did not keep their proper abode, did not stay, we can say, in the sphere which God had marked out for them.\n\nDo we realize that God's laws are like a boundary around us, which shows us the sphere in which we are to live all our life? When we move out of them, we commit exactly the same sin that those angels did in the days of Noah. And what did God do? Even though they were angels he had created, even though at one time they were holy, even though at one time they were under the anointing, God took it all away and created\n\nWhat did he do? He has kept them in eternal bonds under darkness for the judgment of that great day. We can also learn another lesson from this verse and that is in terms of our ministry. There is a boundary that God has drawn around us for our life and that is through the commandments. There is also a boundary that God's drawn around each of us for our ministry. For example, God has told women that they are to be under the authority of men.\n\nAnd when a woman goes outside her boundary and seeks to enter into the ministry which God has called a man to, she is committing the same sin that the angels did. This is a sin which people are committing not only in the heathen world, in the Christian world too. Around all people God has drawn a circle. The only one without a boundary in the universe is God himself. Everyone else has got a boundary around himself. And if we are humble,\n\nand wise, we will recognize the boundary God has drawn around us. We shall not get into competition with another brother who has a ministry around which, around him, God's drawn perhaps a bigger circle than he's drawn around ours. But that's none of our business. We are to stay in the sphere that God has drawn around us. That's our salvation. Outside our boundary, we'll only find the devil. Inside our boundary, we shall find God.\n\nAnd this is the reason why many Christians go astray. We read in Acts of the Apostles in chapter 17, when Paul was speaking to the people in Athens, he says, God has made boundaries so that within them, within those boundaries, Acts 17, 27, they should seek for God and find him there. Whom do we find outside that boundary? We find the devil. That's what Adam found in the Garden of Eden. And that's how he got thrown out.\n\nAnd that's how many people have missed the will of God, by not recognizing the sphere which God had placed them in. And there we are told about the angels and given a warning from their example. In"

    "text": "we're told about the example of Sodom and Gomorrah. He gives us three examples here. First, about the Israelites who came out of Egypt, who were destroyed after they were first converted. And then secondly, he gives us the example of the angels who\n\nwho did not keep their proper abode but went out and sinned. And then third, he gives us the example of Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them which indulged in gross immorality and went after strange flesh. They violated God's laws. They disregarded God's laws. They couldn't care less for the laws that God had made in this area, in this sexual area.\n\nAnd God punished them publicly and it says here, they have been exhibited as an example in undergoing the punishment of eternal fire. Many people don't realize that sexual sin can lead a person into the eternal fires. If you turn to Matthew chapter 5, it's one of the first things that Jesus said in the Sermon on the Mount. He said in the Old Testament, it was commanded, thou shall not commit adultery.\n\nYou have heard that said of old, you shall not commit adultery, Matthew 5.27. But I say to you that everyone who looks on a woman to lust for her has committed adultery with her already in his heart. And if your right eye makes you stumble, tear it out and throw it from you. For it's better for you that one of the parts of your body perish than, listen to this, than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.\n\nThink of that, that sexual sin can lead a person to an eternal hell. And Jesus says, not just about physical adultery. He's speaking here about lusting after a woman with your eyes. There are very few Christians who take that matter seriously. They don't realize that lusting after a woman with your eyes is the first step towards hell.\n\nWhy is that? Because they have turned the grace of God into licentiousness. They have turned the grace of God into an excuse for sinning. They can live as they like. They can look and lust and do what they like. Because the grace of God cleanses them. This is the deception into which Satan has brought them. They have been led astray from the true faith which has been delivered once for all to the saints. And this is the faith which Jude says we must now fight for.\n\nIf your right eye causes you to stumble, tear it out. If your right hand makes you stumble, cut it off. A radical attitude towards sin is what Jesus taught in this sexual area. But the people in Sodom and Gomorrah, they sinned not only in terms of adultery, but in homosexuality, in sexual perversion. And it says here that God has set them up as an example to the whole world, for those who have eyes to see and ears to hear.\n\nof the way God hates sexual perversion. Now we are living in days when Jesus said the last days will be like the days of Lot in Sodom and Gomorrah. The sins of Sodom and Gomorrah have spread all over the world today. And that's one reason why God has allowed dreadful diseases like AIDS, for example, which has come around the world to show God's hatred of these things. Let's come back to the true faith.\n\nto a radical attitude against sin, to that grace of God manifested in Christ, which not only forgives us from sin, but delivers us from sin's power.

It's good always to limit ourselves to speak and talk about the things which we have understood and experienced and to be small in our own eyes so that we don't seek for honor for ourselves by talking about great and mighty things. You may have heard some other brother talk about these things. Maybe that lies within his boundary and God has given him authority and authority\n\nwidened his circle so that he could speak about these things. But if he hasn't given you that, you are not to speak about it. No, these men revile the things which they don't understand. And the things which they know by instinct, like unreasoning animals, by these things they are destroyed. Jude says these people have reduced themselves to the level of unreasoning animals. When a man defiles his body and lives according to the lust of the flesh,\n\nHe descends to the level of an animal. An animal does not have any self-restraint when it comes to sexual matters. And when a human being who is created in the image of God and one who claims to have accepted Christ and the true grace of God lives in that way, he's descended to the level of an animal too.\n\nAnimals don't know authority. They couldn't care less for an authority. The tiger in the forest, the lion in the forest, they don't bother about authority. And when a man lives like that, he's descended to the level of an animal.

These are the people who will make a shipwreck of your church.\n\nHidden reefs means the hidden rocks which you can't see on the surface, which a ship goes and collides again and the ship is wrecked. These are the hidden reefs. Be careful. You remember when Paul was leaving the church in Ephesus, he called the elders together in Acts chapter 20. He said, as long as I was with you, these men who are seeking to lead people after themselves did not have power. But after my departure, he says,\n\nThese ravenous wolves will come into the midst of the flock and draw away to the disciples after them. How is it that these people did not get power as long as Paul was there? Because he radically spoke the word of God that such people never got power in that church. But we find that when Paul left, the others were not so radical. And later on you find in Revelation chapter 2, the church in Ephesus has descended to such a low state, just like Paul predicted.\n\nThese men are the people who will make a shipwreck of your church. They are hidden reefs in your love feast. They sit in your love feast, feasting with you without any fear. They have no scruples. Without any fear, it says they care only for themselves.\n\nThey look after none but themselves. Shepherds who feed only themselves. Shepherds who are interested not in feeding the flock, but in feeding themselves. We are warned about such shepherds. And dear friends, Christianity today abounds with such shepherds who are seeking to feed only themselves. Do you have a shepherd who is only interested in feeding himself? He can never lead you to a godly life.\n\nBecause he doesn't have the spirit of Christ. Christ didn't come seeking his own. No, these people care for themselves, feed themselves. They are clouds without water. Deceptive. You see a black cloud in the sky and you think it's going to rain. It comes over and just passes over. You don't get any rain at all. Hollow. They don't bless you. There's no blessing of the spirit in their ministry. Carried about by the winds. Every wind of doctrine. Push this way, that way.\n\nAutumn trees without fruit, doubly dead, uprooted. The Spirit of God tries to use every type of example to illustrate the emptiness, hollowness, fruitlessness, and deception of such people who seek to make shipwreck of a church by perverting the grace of God into licentiousness. Wild waves of the sea casting up their own shame like foam. Wandering stars,\n\nThat means stars that once started out on the right course but have missed the course and they've gone away from the track that God has marked out for them. When you look up into the skies, you find that the stars keep the course that God has marked out for them. You read of shooting stars. These are the ones that have wandered out of course. Meteorites that have left the track God has appointed for them. He says there are people like that in Christendom. Wandering stars.\n\nwhich don't follow any orbit, go outside the boundary God's appointed for them. To such people, the only thing that's reserved, Jude says, is the black darkness of eternity. Forever doomed to utter darkness.\n\nMany people think that when we speak about the gospel, we have to be so gentle and so gracious and so diplomatic. Well, Jude was not very diplomatic when he said that people were like wandering stars for whom the black darkness of eternity had been reserved. He wasn't diplomatic when he said that they were clouds without water and all the other horrible expressions he uses here because he earnestly contended for the faith. And he's telling the other believers, fight for it, brothers and sisters.\n\nFight for this true faith that has been delivered to us.

That's the difference. When you bring division in the midst of ungodly people, you become an agent in Satan's hands.

He who sows discord among God-fearing brothers...\n\nis one whom God hates. These are the ones who separate themselves, who make separations and cause divisions, who, like Paul says, draw away disciples after themselves for their own personal ends. When we stand up for the truth, we don't have to make any separation. Those who belong to darkness will separate themselves from us automatically. We don't have to separate ourselves.
